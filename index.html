		I am a fifth-year PhD student at the University of Chicago, Harris School of Public Policy. I use causal inference, machine learning, web scraping and a toolkit of econometric and statistical methods to study identity-based consumer behavior and infrastructure investments targeted to marginalized identity groups. 
		Prior to my doctoral research, I worked as a pre-doctoral researcher at Stanford University. I hold a B.A. in Economics (with distinction) from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai.
