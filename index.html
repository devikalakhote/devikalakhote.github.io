		I am a Data Scientist at 3ie. 
		I use causal inference, AI, machine learning, web scraping and a toolkit of 
		econometric and statistical methods for impact evaluation and synthesis. 
		Prior to joining 3ie, I received my PhD in Public Policy from the University of Chicago. 
		My doctoral research examines identity-based consumer behavior and the effects of 
		infrastructure policies targeted to marginalized identity groups. You can find a copy of my dissertation
